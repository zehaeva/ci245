#J.36

Five programmers sit at a round table with laptops in front of them and exactly one bottomless can of Red Bull is placed in between each of them.  Each programmer must alternately write code and take a drink of Red Bull.  However these programmers always double fist their Red Bull so they will not drink any unless they have a Red Bull in each hand.  Obviously each programmer can only obtain a can if it is not being held onto by another programmer.  After the programmer drinks they put down the cans and they are available to other programmers for nourishment.  A programmer can grab a can to the left or right of them at any time but they cannot start drinking until they have both.

You can make a programmer drink and write code for any amount of time you like greater than one-tenth second but the program must continue successfully until each programmer has written code for 25 iterations.  You must successfully avoid deadlock.
