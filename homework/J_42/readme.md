Implement the GUI for Minesweeper. You do not need to implement the rules of the game.
All of the squares should be uncovered in your game.
You should create a 30 x 16 grid of components of your choice (buttons, panels, whatever, hereafter referred to as Squares) then randomly place 99 mines on the board. The other Squares should label how many mines that particular square is touching. If a square touches no mine then it should be blank. You will implement the GUI as if they all have been "pressed" (i.e. you can see the bombs, numbers or blanks).
You must implement two distinct design patterns and explain the implementation and purpose of each to your instructor.
