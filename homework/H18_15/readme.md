# 18.15 Eight Queens

A Puzzler for chess buffs, is the Eright Queens problem, which asks, 
is it possible to place eight queens on an empty chessboard so that no queen is attacking any other queen, 
that is if a queen is placed in the upper-left corner of the board, no other quesns could be placed in the same column, row, or diagonal. 
Solve this recursively.
