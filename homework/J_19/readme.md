# J.19
Write me a sorting class that has a method which takes in a List of Integer objects as an input.  
The method should then sort the List using the Merge Sort (see pg 827) algorithm and return a COPY of the original list.  
The original list should not be changed.  
Write a test program which generates a random list, sorts it, then prints out the original List and the newly sorted List.  
*You MUST use lists throughout, you cannot use any arrays!*
