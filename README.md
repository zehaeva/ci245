My Java course with Covey

Here I'll be keeping track of my homework, labs, and final project.

##After course update

Out of the approximate 110 assignments 
I completed all but 6.
Finished 6 extra credit assignments 

The two projects, the Midterm and the Final were both successes.

The Midterm was a graph coloring exercise, which is hard to grade but concensus was that I was one of most successful projects

The final went well, Of the project scope I submitted to Covey I succeeded in all but one of the features I promised, Attack Spells was just a bit too much in the time frame I had.

My Proposal was:
* I want to create a Tactical RPG
* It will be a turn based game.
* It will be a single player game
* it will have units with stats
* It will have a grid on which to move units
* the units will be able to perform actions on each other
  * attack
  * cast spells
* rudimentary ai will be implemented for the opposing side
* the winner is the side that has  eliminated all the opposing side's units.
