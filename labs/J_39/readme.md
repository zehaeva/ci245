Use the Command design pattern to add Undo functionality to Edit menu of your Notepad applications.  
Only update the text box through a special function you create.  
In the special function PUSH the current value of the text box onto a stack then make your change. 
When you click undo POP the last value off the stack and write it to the text box.
