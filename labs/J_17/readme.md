# J.17
Write a program that takes in words from the user and stores them in a List.  
Now use a Set to remove duplicates (see figure 16.16 on pg 711-712) and sorts the words within the set and prints them out.  
Then sort the words within the set in reverse and print the results of that operation.  
Do this with both a HashSet and a SortedSet.  
Which one requires more code to accomplish the task with, if any at all?  
You may only use a HashSet and a SortedSet, no other collection types, including arrays, may be used.
