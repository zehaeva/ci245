J.15: Review the following Wikipedia article: Combinations.  You will start with my Combination.java file and compute the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time using a non-recursive and recursive algorithm.  The non-recursive method will use factorials and the recursive method should not.  I have included a factorial method which you can use in your implementations. Try not to be too jealous of my for loop.  Everything you need mathematically is in the Wikipedia article.
