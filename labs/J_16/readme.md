Given an array of Integers print out the Power Set of the array and the number of sets contained within the Power Set that you calculated (this should help you know you have it right, there should be exactly 2^N elements where N is the number of elements in the original set).  
Don't forget about the empty set!  
When I say set I mean mathematical set not the Java object Set.  
You must use recursion to solve this problem!
