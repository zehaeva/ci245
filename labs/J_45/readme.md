##J.45: 
Create a simple GUI program which allows a user to login and register for a "system".  
The program should use a simple text file database that stores usernames and the hash (algorithm is your choice) of the password.
The GUI should check to see that the hash of the password entered by the user matches the hash of the password in your text file. 
A user can click register instead in which case his username and hashed password will be added to the database.
